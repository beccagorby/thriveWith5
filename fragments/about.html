    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>After seeing old acquaintances from high school do well in other network marketing companies, I decided I could, and wanted, to do it too. They all spoke about extra money, more freedom, and new friendships that it brought them and I wanted in. The key element to being successful in network marketing, however, is to LOVE the product. You have to believe in it and want to share it with everyone because it is so great. There was my dilemma, I didn't feel that passion for those companies or products so I set out on my search.</p>
    <p>I spent days and weeks researching and reading about numerous direct sales companies. I wanted to know everything: the products sold, compensation plan, monthly requirements, fees, the ways allowed to sell and share, how the company started, mission statement, etc. I had my own requirements in mind and was searching for my perfect fit. I wanted low to no monthly requirements and fees, a product that if I was invited to a party I would be excited to attend and buy, and not feel guilty for spending a fortune. I wanted a mission that spoke to me, founders that are compassionate and dedicated, not a lot of restrictions on how I can run my business and what I am allowed to do. I also wanted a company that was newer, it would be fresh and exciting to talk about. One I would get more responses like, "What is that?" rather than, "I've heard about them." All the companies I have already heard of never stuck out to me so I started my search with reports on growing companies, made a list of the names, and looked them up one by one.</p>
    <p>Some of the companies found in my search seemed ok, but then I came across Paparazzi and I was in love! It was the perfect match, everything about it spoke to me. The price point, inventory, always changing, mission statement, colors, commission, building a team; it all fit me so well. I had never heard of the company and knew that I needed to share it and it would be perfect for others as well. I didn't know anyone selling it and with the price point and fact that the kit came with a "repair kit", I was a little skeptical and worried about the quality. I needed to see and feel it in person before I could make any big decisions. I looked through the consultant search and there weren't many options around me. I read the bios of all the girls that had a picture and messaged one that seemed the best fit for me. She met me for coffee, showed me the accessories, and answered any last questions I couldn't find the answers to through my research.</p>
    <p>I was so impressed with the quality and signed up shortly after. I was, and am, very serious about it as a business so I got the largest kit to get the most pieces with the best value & a free convention ticket. My favorite part about being a Paparazzi girl is that I sell a product that everyone can afford and help women boost their confidence. I love building and helping my team which is why I created this site. My goal is to have a resource that answers every question as well as contains the training to make others successful. Like I said in the weeks of researching numerous sites and resources to find what I needed, there wasn't a site that contained it all. I am creating this to try to save some time for others that want to know it all like me. :) if there is anything you would like to see added or questions I didn't cover, please contact me!</p>

    <h3>About Our Founders</h3>
    <p>When sisters Misty and Chani began selling jewelry, their original intent wasn't to begin a national phenomenon. "We just enjoyed showing people how to accessorize," explains Misty. But what began as a whim was clearly filling a need.</p>
    <p>Women flocked to buy accessories that were trendy, but not too intimidating. Classic, but never boring. And best of all, incredibly affordable. At just $5 per piece, Paparazzi Accessories became an invitation to experiment with color, try a more daring style, and do it without risk of buyer's regret. Paparazzi made fashionable finds accessible for every outfit, for every age group, and for every sense of style. The company grew 900% in just six months.</p>
    <p>Today, the concept of "accessibility" extends to the very mission of Paparazzi. Accessories are sold exclusively through Paparazzi Consultants, and anyone who wishes to sell the line can do it for themselves. The result is a flourishing business that empowers women and builds self-assurance with a fun financial future.</p>
    <p>Paparazzi founders Misty and Trent Kirby, and Chani and Ryan Reeve, continue to expand the company with hands-on leadership and clear purpose. They individually design and source materials for Paparazzi products while working directly with manufacturing partners to create the fashion-forward results.</p>
